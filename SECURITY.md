* DO respect the availability, confidentiality and privacy of our services, users and any 3rd party systems
* DO NOT attack or otherwise interfere with any account you are not the owner of
* DO NOT violate any applicable laws or regulations
* DO NOT disclose issues publicly before we've had time to assess and respond appropriately
